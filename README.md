# Assembler-CPU

# Description
This project has two sections :
1. Design an assembler, which is implemented in Java programming language
2. Design a 6-bit processor with VHDL programming language

## Section-1 (Assembler)
In the first section :
- As input, the assembly code is given,
- Then, our assembler converts it to the corresponding binary code

## Section-2 (Processor)
In the second section :
- The mentioned processor consisted of 7 main parts, namely :
   
    - main registers
    - counter
    - instruction register
    - ROM memory
    - control unit
    - ALU
    - Buses

Then we will check the validity of the Assembler, using the processor.
